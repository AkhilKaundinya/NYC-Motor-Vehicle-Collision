## Problem Statement
### Introduction
This repository contains an in-depth analysis of motor vehicle collisions in New York City (NYC). The aim of this project is to gain valuable insights into the factors contributing to accidents, identify high-risk areas, and propose data-driven recommendations to improve road safety..

### Business Understanding
Road safety is a critical concern in NYC, where motor vehicle collisions have significant social and economic impacts. Understanding the patterns and causes of accidents can help various stakeholders, including city authorities, transportation agencies, and insurance companies, make informed decisions to mitigate risks and create safer streets for residents and visitors.

### Business Objectives
We currently have a dataset contains comprehensive information on police-reported motor vehicle collisions in New York City (NYC).Each row represents a crash event, injuries, fatalities, or significant property damage.

The primary goal is to improve traffic safety in New York City by leveraging data-driven insights to address and mitigate motor vehicle collisions.The key tasks performed to achieve this objective includes:

#### 1. Data Gathering
Diverse collision data was collected using NYC's Open Data portal, Google Big Query datasets, and third-party sources to ensure a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

#### 2.Data Profiling and Quality Assurance: 
Used Alteryx  for in-depth data profiling, allowing for a thorough understanding of data characteristics and identification of any quality issues.

#### 3. Dimensional Modeling: 
A preliminary dimensional model was created using ER studios
Identifying key facts and dimensions for insightful analysis.

#### 4. Data Integration: 
Used Talend and Alteryx:-
1. To design data integration workflows
2. Data standardization and Data manipulation
3. To load data into staging tables, ensuring seamless data preparation for analysis.

#### 5. Advanced Data Manipulation and Analytics: 
Python and SQL were employed for advanced data manipulation and analytics.

#### 6. Interactive Dashboards: 
Interactive Tableau and Power BI dashboards were developed, enabling data-driven decision-making for enhancing traffic safety in NYC. These dashboards provide stakeholders with actionable insights for targeted interventions and accident prevention strategies.
